Dev containers, demos, playgrounds, and examples to support (wannabe-awesome) 
[HTTP-request-from-inside-WASM list](https://github.com/vasilev/HTTP-request-from-inside-WASM).

Some principles: 

* In the case the proper example for particular programming language could not be found anywhere on Internet,
just trying to create the own one.
* Examples are simple and short as possible. Consider them as a starting point for your own experiments.

Note: The WASM ecosystem (especially the WASI part) is evolving very fast, so some examples may become outdated.
